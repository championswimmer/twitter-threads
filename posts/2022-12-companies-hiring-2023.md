Yeah there are layoffs happening. But there are pockets where software engineering hiring is also in fact increasing. 

From my unique vantage point I can see that those who got outcompeted in the hiring market in 2021 are backfilling now, at a fast rate. 

Examples below.
Big banks are all hiring (latest openings, within last few days) 

Not the sexiest jobs on the market by the usual playbook, of going to bigtech and product startups, but these are good jobs actually, and pay near, or just above median. [pic.twitter.com/uqq8csYoVJ](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1595809372981952512/photo/1)

Big retail companies with Indian GDCs (global development centers) are also hiring, lots of new openings lately

I have personally worked at Target before, and engineering in these places is actually much better than what you expect from outside

The old-tech, or core-tech companies (who make machines, and electronics and industrial tools) are also hiring. 

Albeit the roles are different here. More embedded engineering, electronics background helps, and C++ & C# is also fairly common [pic.twitter.com/snEAAeQki1](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1595810899486380033/photo/1)

Guess which other sector is back to building phase? Aviation ofcourse. And again lots of software roles, but again be warned this is not info-systems or web-CRUDs. Fairly different types of software though they have consumer-facing apps (which they outsource) [pic.twitter.com/45nTs5QbRG](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1595811787374759937/photo/1)

Airlines back home are hiring too as well 

Indigo and AirAsia both do in-house development of their consumer platforms (apps, websites, ticketing). And thus they have openings in web dev as well as DevOps. [pic.twitter.com/FqclTsd5Cw](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1595812301973528577/photo/1)

Ok, if you are too bored with the "unsexy" companies, there are some sexier ones too. 

Deliveroo opened India GDC recently. Atlassian continues to hire in India. So is Grab [pic.twitter.com/hiPQQTvABw](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1595814290086580224/photo/1)

Another sector - cloud automotive services. 

Tekion and it's competitor CDK both are hiring [pic.twitter.com/kM5eTUmcUg](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1595815108453736450/photo/1)

If you thought Fintech was having a bad time, think again 

Let the real fintech stand up. The ones actually running most of the global finance infra and making profits. 

Paypal, Visa, Mastercard and Amex are all hiring with lots of open positions. [pic.twitter.com/uwb4QD6sXE](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1595816778009284608/photo/1)

Sneaker sales are obviously not down, and Adidas and Nike are also hiring software engineers. 

Nike has some seriously good fitness products (apps, backend, data analytics) - can give Fitbit a run for their money. [pic.twitter.com/xaSrTnE1dL](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1595818020554711040/photo/1)

Intuit is hiring like crazy too. LOTS of openings. 

So is SAP and Salesforce (not as many roles though) 

Also Zoho, which just reached $1B in revenues.

P.S. Salesforce has done layoffs in US [pic.twitter.com/iuZWFBXlVS](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1595819716513525760/photo/1)

It is not like Indian startups (rather scaleups) are not hiring 

[@RazorpayEngg](https://twitter.com/RazorpayEngg) is hiring many roles 
YUBI (formerly CREDAvenue) as well 
Some roles in [@InMobi](https://twitter.com/InMobi) too [pic.twitter.com/PTaYTJgxEs](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1595823114474045440/photo/1)
